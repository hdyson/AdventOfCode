* Summary

Using [[https://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code]] as an excuse to learn some
Swift (so the code here won't be idiomatic, or polished; it's a repository for
exploring and understanding).

* Usage

Build scheme options have to be updated in Xcode to spoecify correct input
file per puzzle (assuming building and running within Xcode).  Input files are
user-specific, so if you're not me, the ones in this repo won't work for you.
